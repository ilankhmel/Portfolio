            Hello! My name is Ilan and I enjoy creating things that live on the
            internet. My journey into coding as a marketing specialist stemmed
            from the desire to deliver outstanding results for clients. By
            leveraging HTML, CSS, and implementing tracking codes, I was able to
            improve website performance, enhance user engagement, and provide
            valuable insights to guide marketing strategies. I learned that
            coding is so much fun!
          </p>

          <p>
            In the present day, I have successfully completed an intensive and
            rigorous 4-month full-stack development bootcamp at{" "}
            <a href=""> CodingAcademy.</a> This comprehensive program demanded
            my commitment five days a week, from morning till night, providing
            me with a deep understanding of various aspects of full-stack
            development.
          </p>

            Here are a few <a href=""> technologies</a> Iâ€™ve been working with
            recently:

    </div>
  );
